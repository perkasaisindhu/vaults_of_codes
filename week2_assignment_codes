WEEK-2
ASSIGNMENT-2
1.	. Write a program to count word frequencies in a given text.

def count_word_frequencies(text):
    words = text.split()
    word_freq = {}
    for word in words:
        word = word.strip('.,!?"\'')
        word = word.lower()
        if word:
            word_freq[word] = word_freq.get(word, 0) + 1
    return word_freq
text = """Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming."""
word_frequencies = count_word_frequencies(text)
print("Word Frequencies:")
for word, frequency in word_frequencies.items():
    print(f"{word}: {frequency}")

output:

Word Frequencies:
python: 1
is: 1
a: 1
widely: 1
used: 1
high-level: 1
programming: 2
language: 1
for: 1
general-purpose: 1


2.	Palindrome Checker 
Write a program that checks if a given word is a palindrome.

def is_palindrome(word):
    word = word.replace(" ", "").lower()
    return word == word[::-1]
word = input("Enter a word: ")
if is_palindrome(word):
    print(f"{word} is a palindrome.")
else:
    print(f"{word} is not a palindrome.")

output:
Enter a word: noon
noon is a palindrome.

Enter a word: python
python is not a palindrome.


3.	List Manipulation
 Create a list of numbers, then write a program that prints the square of each number in the list.

def print_square(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        print(f"The square of {num} is {num**2}")
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print_square(numbers)

Output:
The square of 1 is 1
The square of 2 is 4
The square of 3 is 9
The square of 4 is 16
The square of 5 is 25
